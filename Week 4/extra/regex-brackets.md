In regular expressions (regex), different types of brackets have different meanings:

1. **Round Brackets `()`**:
   - Used for grouping parts of a regular expression.
   - Can also be used for capturing groups.
   - Example: `(abc)+` matches "abc" one or more times as a group.

2. **Square Brackets `[]`**:
   - Denote a character class, matching any single character within the brackets.
   - Can specify ranges or individual characters.
   - Example: `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.

3. **Curly Brackets `{}`**:
   - Denote quantifiers, specifying the number of occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `{n}` matches exactly n occurrences.
   - `{n,m}` matches at least n and at most m occurrences.
   - `{n,}` matches at least n occurrences.
   - Example: `a{2,4}` matches "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa".

4. **Angle Brackets `<>`**:
   - Not commonly used in standard regex. They're sometimes used in specific regex flavors for special purposes.

5. **Braces `{}`**:
   - Braces can also represent literal characters in some regex engines if they're escaped or if they're not part of a quantifier pattern.

Each type of bracket serves a specific purpose in constructing regular expressions and has its own set of rules and meanings.
